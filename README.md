##Storyline:

You wake up lying in a pool of blood on a hard wood floor, staring up at a dimly lit chandelier covered in cobwebs on the ceiling. 
Next to you is a heavy locked door. There are 4 keyholes. How did you get here? You must escape.

To escape you must find the key to the main door in each room (one key per room?) by solving various riddles and puzzles.

At the end of the game you are pushed down the stairs and die. You end up just as you began the story, lying in a pool of blood by the stairs. The never-ending loop continues once more.
